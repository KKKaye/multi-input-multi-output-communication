MIMO is one of the key enabling technologies of broadband wireless. It makes use of multiple antennas in communication. Multi-antenna is not new; it has been used in diversity reception for decades. Traditionally, fading in wireless channels was regarded as a nuisance, which was combated by means of diversity, namely, receiving many copies of a signal from different antennas. In contrast, fading is now seen as a beneficial factor in MIMO communication. In MIMO communication, antennas are usually far spaced so as to achieve independent fading. It in fact takes advantage of independence naturally provided by fading to create multiple spatial channels in parallel. Hence, higher channel capacity is obtained over the same bandwidth, thereby higher spectral efficiency.
